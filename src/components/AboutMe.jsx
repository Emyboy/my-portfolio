                                Few years ago I started out as a 3D artist creating stunning visual effect and motion graphics
                                for Films and commercials, down the line I fell in love with software in general and always wondered how they worked.

                            <p>
                                After two years of working in the wold of visual effects I was introduced to python by a friend after I asked him
                                what will be the language of choice when it came to writing desktop applications.

                                After few weeks of learning python I decided to attend a boot camp that was organized by a company named Andela, here
                                I was introduced to the world of web development and ever since then I've been a full stack web developer.
